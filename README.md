### Hi there! My name is Dwight Van Lancker ðŸ‘‹

In 2019, I graduated as an Information Technology Engineer (ITE) as the University of Ghent, located in Belgium. I immediatly start working, as an information architect at the government agency 'Digitaal Vlaanderen'. At Digitaal Vlaanderen, I'm part of the team called Open Standards for Linked Organizations (OSLO), mainly focussing on creating (open) data standards and implementing them in datasets!

Today, I am still working there :smiley:!

ðŸ”­ Currently, my main focus is on Linked Data Event Streams. Linked Data Event Streams are a new, really cool way to publish your datasets, giving users access to the full history and the latest changes of your dataset. More information on this topic can be found here:
- A (specification)[https://w3id.org/ldes/specification] that tells you how to publish your dataset as a LDES
- A (paper)[https://github.com/ddvlanck/Publishing-Base-Registries-As-LDES/blob/master/Linked-Data-Event-Streams.pdf] describing this vision
- A free (course)[https://academy.europa.eu/courses/publishing-data-with-linked-data-event-streams-why-and-how?lang=sv] with videos explaining the what's and how's

Most of my time I spend developing tools for the LDES ecosystem or publishing a dataset as a LDES. (Ofcourse using the data standards developed by OSLO as much as possible. ðŸ˜‰)
